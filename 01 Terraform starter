Recommendation for Getting Started with Terraform

1. Begin by familiarizing yourself with Terraform basics.  
2. Practice creating simple resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, and IAM roles/policies.  
3. Learn key concepts including:
   - Dependencies  
   - Data blocks
   - Functions 
   - Conditional expressions  
   - Declaring variables and outputs
  
4. Gradually refactor your resources into modules, then call those modules to provision the same infrastructure.  
5. Use tfvars files to manage environment-specific configurations:
   - dev.tfvars for development  
   - tst.tfvars for testing  
6. Once comfortable, integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, Jenkins, or GitLab to automate deployments.  
7. This workflow allows you to showcase your ability to manage infrastructure as code, maintain consistency across environments, and streamline deployments.
