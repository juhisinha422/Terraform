Ever wondered how to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management without recreating it?

That’s where terraform import comes in. 🔄

🔹 What is it?
 terraform import is a command that allows you to import existing infrastructure (like an Azure VM, AWS S3 bucket, etc.) into your Terraform state.

🔹 Why use it?
 ✅ Migrate resources into IaC without downtime
 ✅ Avoid “terraform destroying” and recreating existing production resources
 ✅ Gain visibility and control through versioned infrastructure code

🔹 How it works:
Define the resource block in your .tf file
Run terraform import <resource_address> <resource_id>
Terraform maps the resource into your state file
Follow up with terraform plan to verify consistency

🧠 Pro Tip:
 After importing, always run terraform plan and update your .tf files to reflect the full configuration — terraform import doesn't write code, it only updates the state!
